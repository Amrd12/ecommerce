This case strikes a great balance between style and functionality, providing adequate protection while maintaining a sleek and professional appearance.One of the standout features of this case is its sturdy construction. The materials used feel durable and capable of withstanding everyday wear and tear. The case snugly fits my iPad Pro, ensuring a secure and precise fit. I appreciate the reinforced corners, which provide added shock absorption and protect the device against accidental drops.The design of the case is minimalist and elegant. It adds a touch of sophistication to my iPad Pro without adding unnecessary bulk. The slim profile of the case allows for easy handling and effortless transportation. It also doesn't interfere with any of the device's functionalities, including the buttons, ports, and cameras. All the necessary cutouts are well-aligned, providing convenient access without any obstructions.The case offers versatile viewing angles, thanks to its built-in stand feature. This allows me to comfortably watch videos, browse the internet, or work on my iPad Pro without straining my neck. The stand is sturdy and holds the tablet securely in both landscape and portrait orientations.However, one aspect that could be improved is the closure mechanism. The case utilizes a magnetic closure, which isn't as secure as a strap or a snap closure. While it generally keeps the case closed, it can sometimes come undone if not properly aligned or with rough handling. A more secure closure system would provide additional peace of mind when carrying the iPad Pro in a bag or during travel.Overall, the Case for iPad Pro 10.5-Inch offers reliable protection and a stylish design. Its sturdy construction ensures the safety of my tablet, while the slim profile adds a touch of elegance. The built-in stand is a useful feature, providing versatile viewing angles. Though the magnetic closure could be more secure, it doesn't detract significantly from the overall functionality of the case. If you're looking for a practical and visually appealing case for your iPad Pro, this is a great option to consider.","[{""asin"":""B07QNR7LTH"",""name"":""Space Gray""},{""asin"":""B074GSXYB2"",""name"":""Rose""},{""asin"":""B07QMSX6JG"",""name"":""Papaya""},{""asin"":""B07175N8XP"",""name"":""Black""},{""asin"":""B0731HDQT7"",""name"":""Grey""},{""asin"":""B07QSWQMCS"",""name"":""Matcha Green""},{""asin"":""B07QMSVY6P"",""name"":""Misty Blue""},{""asin"":""B07QQZDV88"",""name"":""Light Purple""},{""asin"":""B0731HR3FJ"",""name"":""Red""},{""asin"":""B0731FB9T3"",""name"":""Blue""},{""asin"":""B07QQZF6ZP"",""name"":""Light Blue""},{""asin"":""B07QMSW7GK"",""name"":""Navy""}]","[""FREE delivery Monday, August 28 on orders shipped by Amazon over $35"",""Or fastest delivery Friday, August 25.

I eventually decided that I really needed to invest into another case! The clear one had cracked within 1 and 1/2 months of the purchase. I don't usually take my laptop anywhere but school and my house ever, so I was surprised when I saw a crack! I also didn't want to spend a lot of money on a case, so I chose this case, and I'm glad I did! The color is a little more purple than what I thought it would be, but i'm ok with that. I literally didn't need instructions to put this case on, and it took me about 20 seconds to put the top and bottom on the laptop. Super easy to just click on. I also noticed the matte finish or something on this, and I am loving it! My other case was a hard plastic that was slippery. This one is NOT SLIPPERY!! My ONLY complaint would be that this specific color is not super sheer, and that's sort of what I was looking for. Not a huge deal, and certainly not a dealbreaker! Overall, this case is super easy and simple to install, not to mention quick! It has great color, good feel, and fits so seamlessly, it's amazing! I am honestly surprised that there are not as many good reviews as there should be for this case. Loving it and thanks for making such a durable, and sharp looking case!

IOGear GCS1942 DisplayPort KVM.  My previous setup was a pair of 27"" WQHD monitors with DVI-D inputs, and  used an older IOGear DIV-D KVM which is also a dual-view KVM.  I can then run two computers with dual monitors.So, I tried FOUR other KVM's, and had issues all around.  Issues like the monitors ""forgetting"" window locations, monitors powering down, monitors not being recognized, proper resolutions and refresh rates not being recognizable, poor video quality, and having to try adapters to connect everything.  I spent DAYS messing with settings, drivers, adapters, resetting everything, clean installing everything ... what a hassle.  I returned them all.Due to the reliability of my old IOGear KVM, which is easily 10 years old, I decided to suck it up and spend the $433 for this new version.  Long story short, this KVM is worth every penny!!!Computers:*  Custom PC with GTX-970 which has a single DisplayPort and single HDMI output.  I had to buy an active adapter for my GTX-970's HDMI port.* A 2019 Dell laptop for work, with a USB-C Dell D6000 docking port, with two DisplayPort outputs.Results:YES, I WOULD BUY THIS AGAIN even though it was $433 - it is worth every penny.PROS:* Very good quality, just like my old IOGear KVM.  Big metal housing, clearly labelled ports, easy to use.* 4 DisplayPort cables included!  All you need are the DP cables to your monitors.* Proper support of 4K 60Hz resolutions, which looks flawless on my LG 32"" 4K monitors.* Familiar (at least for me) hotkey operation, the same as my old IOGear KVM.  Just press [scroll lock][scroll lock][enter] and you switch to the next PC.* This KVM supports the ""monitor is powered on"" protocol when disconnected.  This is VERY important - it means that when you switch from one PC to the next, and then come back, all your windows are in the same place, the resolution is the same, and it's PERFECT.* Supports wireless keyboard and mouse.  Do NOT believe the IOGear support folks who say you need a wired keyboard or their IOGear keyboard.  I am using an HP wireless keyboard and mouse, which is 5-6 years old, and I simply plugged the wireless USB nubs into the appropriate ports on the back of the KVM.  If you plug them into the ""standard"" USB port, then it will NOT work, so pay attention!CONS:* Switching PC's takes about 2-3 seconds, instead of the 1-2 seconds of my old KVM.  Horrors!  LOL.  :)* It is pretty big, so check the measurements.  I put mine on a shelf behind my monitors so I don't see it and don't care.* The cables are only 4' or 5' long.  Adding an extra foot or two length would have been helpful for me, but that is most because I have an antique desk and have to run the cables out my PC, under the back wall, then 4' up to the top or a raised shelf on the back.* It's $433!  I hate paying that much money, but then again my last one lasted 10+ years and I use it every day for work.  Plus, this works FLAWLESSLY.  I figure it's worth it.","[{""asin"":""B07WRN3FZN"",""name"":""2-Port USB-C""},{""asin"":""B08DKRG51P"",""name"":""2-Port USB KVM Switch KIT""},{""asin"":""B004YCUDMU"",""name"":""2-Port HDMI""},{""asin"":""B07W5K22BK"",""name"":""2-Port VGA DisplayPort KVM Switch Kit""},{""asin"":""B001S2PJO6"",""name"":""4-Port VGA""},{""asin"":""B002TQYSN8"",""name"":""2-Port DVI with Audio""},{""asin"":""B002K0TU2C"",""name"":""2-Port VGA with Audio""},{""asin"":""B076ZDQDN4"",""name"":""2-Port DisplayPort""},{""asin"":""B001D1UTC4"",""name"":""2-Port VGA""},{""asin"":""B07KYRV6VJ"",""name"":""4-Port DisplayPort""},{""asin"":""B00JVV8XL2"",""name"":""2-Port 2-Port USB DVI""},{""asin"":""B07KGLC4Y1"",""name"":""2-Port 4K Dual View 2-Port 4K Dual View""}]","[""FREE delivery Sunday, June 30"",""Or fastest delivery Saturday, June 29.

Tape the small parts to the frames please!For the price these are probably OK racks, a little flimsy. I'd like to see the connections of the frame parts was a bit more solid. Two of the cage nuts were not threaded and I was out of other ones, so contacted TGripp-Lite customer support to see if they could just drop me some replacement in the email. Simple request. Their support is slow and pathetic. Contacted by two different folks who seem confused what a cage nut is. What they heck are those folks doing in Tripp Lite support. Makes me think I won't buy more from them, I'd hate to be dealing with a complex support issue. I gave up and ordered 100 Acinfinity 6mm cage nuts and screws from Amazon, and they are better made, and easier to install than the ones supplied by Tripp Lite.Great value for a mini rack Easy to assemble but fits almost anywhere, anywhere you need a rack for cables, network gear, sound gear this is your pieceThis rack is a fairly decent piece of equipment but it really is very simple. I bought this to hold all my Cisco equipment that I used to study for certification exams. Completely unloaded, the rack seems a little flimsy but once you throw a couple of units in it seems to become more sturdy. I wouldn't put anything that is exceptionally heavy on it or more than one rack unit though unless you ground it to a sturdier base.I felt like the rack might topple if I put my HP rack mount server on it. This rack might work well for a SOHO environment that needs some rack equipment, but without any temperature monitoring or control I'd be cautious about loading this thing up and letting it go.Assembly was a little bit of a headache, but once you figure out that 95% of the pieces in the box are to secure devices, it gets a little easier. I keep about 8 1-Unit devices on it with a rack mount power strip in the middle and it is doing quite well. The rack gets hot if I power on all the devices, but just casual equipment tests work great.The rack seems well-built however the hardware bolts seem very undersized. I'm sure this is by design to accommodate adjustment but it seems a bit excessive. I will definitely upgrade the bolt size. Outside of that I think it's a great product for the price.Fantastic rack, especially for the price. It could stand to be a little more stable, but that's easily enough rectified. As it is with just a patch panel and 1 small switch, it's already doing quite well. Assembly was quick and easy (though instructions could have been a smidgeon more clear, but it wasn't rocket science so doable enough without).The numbered indications and markings for each U of space is quite wonderful and handy. The rack was actually a little shorter than I was expecting. i'm sure it's the right size, but for some reason I was expecting it to be at least a few inches taller. ALl in all, easy setup.The packaging was a little worn, but otherwise in good condition with nothing sticking out. All parts were intact and inside the box, with nary a scuff or scratch on the unit. Absolutely amazing product and experience.(this review is for the 13U size)I bought this rack and a 1U shelf to organize my home networking gear. It's pretty much perfect for the job. My only (tiny) issue is that it's about an inch too tall to fit under the table where I had planned to put it, but that's an easy thing to work around.I was a little surprised that the box included both 12-24 and 10-30 screws. The rack is, of course, threaded for 12-24, so I don't see any reason for the 10-30 to be included.Worked great for my home network lab needs. I only used about 15U slots on it but the rack still wanted to tip backwards from the weight distribution. For best results you'll want to mount this to the floor or on a wider platform with casters to move around if that's your need. Assembly took about 20min.TIP: Don't completely tighten all corners until you've racked some equipment. I thought I had the rack completely square but some of the holes didn't line up with the router ears I had so I had to loosen up the corners and install the router and then go back and tighten up the 2post rack.Used this for a home network setup. In addition to the 48-port switch and power supply, I threw some 1U and 2U shelves on it, and it works like a charm.For the price, you cannot get a better deal!I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this floor standing 45U rack. Easy to setup, and holds a lot of weight without tipping.Es muy peque«Òo, est«≠ inclinado hacia atr«≠s hay que tomar en cuenta eso ya que si se pone un monitor o alg«ßn equipo f«≠cilmente deslizable se puede caer.El Rack es de excelente calidad para equipar un cuarto de telecomunicaciones sencillo pero adecuado para una oficina mediana.

Copies quickly, a one MB folder was completely copied in a little over a minute! No problems at all.As noted in other reviews it worked right out of the pkg on my MacBook Pro w/o any formatting. Used solely to store my tens of thousands photos. Bottom gets pretty warm as it is a HDD & not an SSD. Write speed is slow but I knew that when I bought it for the price. Device side of cable appears proprietary (see photo). Didn't use any of the SW provided on the drive. Nameplate says made in Thailand in 2022.First I love the compact size and then the price for 2T is very good. It wasn't hard to set up with my MacBookPro. Once I went through the downloaded installer and was able to go to the Time Machine in my system preferences and check this as my preferred backup device. The first backup is a little over one hour but I have a lot to download so the time to do this is fine with me. I also liked the fact that it came with a USB-C adaptor so I didn't have to go to an Apple dongle. I have used G Drives in the past but the prices are extremely high now if all you are doing is backing up to your personal computer. I am not a tech savvy person but I didn't need any tech support to get this running.I can use it to secure my important documents.I am using this to back up photos and video clips to relieve brain space on my Mac. Of course, I have another of a different brand as well as extra backup. I had no problems formatting and was able to start dragging & dropping files immediately. Great price for 1TB and a good solution compared to the many, many flashdrives of every high-rated brand under the sun that has failed.It's a fine hard drive for the price, but I bought this because I thought it used a USB-C connection. instead, it's a proprietary connection leading to a USB-A...with an A to C adapter. That means one more thing to remember every time I want to connect this hard drive to a modern computer.I loved this thing since I got it at the tail end of 2019. I save all my important docs, pictures, emulators, etc on this drive. I do not use it for automated backup and I use a Miscrosoft Surface Book 2. My issue with this hard drive is sometimes it takes a while for it to load after putting in my password. The high probability of constantly troubleshooting and losing all of my precious data freaks me out. I can deal with unplugging and re-plugging once or twice to get it to work. Tonight I tried to get it to load for 3 hours, doing combinations of laptop restarts, unplugging and re-plugging, switching power cords, trying to use Toolkit to deactivate the password feature (that's where it always seems to freeze and stop responding). It seems like it doesn't stay powered on long enough through the loading process and just stops responding. I have not tried calling customer support yet as it's almost 23:00 EST as of this writing, but I may try tomorrow. If it is something that is easily fixed, I would love to give it 5 stars.UPDATE 2/22/21: I was finally able to disable password encryption and no issues! 4 stars only because I'm not sure if it will act up again when I re-enable it.Broken down and died after 1 week. I called Seagate, the told me it could happen because the drive is very sensitive!!! How can that be an excuse!! I lost all my data.The 1 star is for Amazon. Returned withought question.I have always used seagate hardrives in the past and I work with large files daily and this was a disappointment. Paid about $200 for the 1TB and i was expecting it to be pretty fast. I tried to transfer a 171GB file from my macbook pro (2019) to my SSD and it took nearly 45 mins!!!! I was also really disappointed with the USB-C adapter it came with, it feels cheap and was super loose and kept disconnecting easily from my macbook. Tried transferring a 10GB file from my husbands PC laptop, took 3mins and 12 seconds... Very disappointed. Now i have to spend more money and see if a USB-C to Micro-B cable would work for this instead or better yet return this and find a better hard drive!Great product BUT, if you have a Mac and are doing your backups in Time Machine, you should know that if you use this as your storage, you can ONLY store the Time Machine backups on it. Nothing else. This means you can't drag folders or add extra photos or anything like this.Also, it does take a bit of figuring out to format the disk to be compatible to do the Time Machine backups, but once that's done it works fine.This drive did not work out for me. It was defective for sure, it would disconnect and stop running while transferring large files. Eventually it was unreadable on two laptops, which it somehow manages to freeze the laptops and a reboot had to happen. I had a lot of data to transfer and was unable to finish. I was able to format the drive after several attempts so I can return it. I wouldn't recommend it for large data transfer.",null,"[""FREE delivery October 12 - 17.

"Sigma BC 14.16 STS Digital Wireless Bicycle Computer w/Optional Cadence | Altitude Functions - Slope, Gradient | Android Phone Pairing | Full Text Display, Auto Start/Stop | IPX8 Water Resistant",ACTÉ??É??É?? EMÉ??É??É??IUMÉ??É??É??,Sigma,"Calling All Hill Climbers! The BC 14.16 STS is the perfect computer for attacking the hills. Enhanced altitude measuring functions include an altitude profile graph and current gradient. Using NFC technology and the free SIGMA LINK app, the BC14.16 STS can communicate with Android smartphones to program and download ride data. Available in a wired, an STS wireless and an STS double wireless version (wireless speed and cadence).   Over 14 functions The more than 14 functions of the BC 14.16 STS are clearly and partly graphically displayed on the large dot matrix display screen. In addition to the classic bike functions, the BC 14.16 STS has six altitude features and in the STS CAD variant, two cadence functions. High-percentage In addition to the classic altimeter functions, the BC 14.16 STS also shows the altitude profile and the ascent percentages.   NFC & Sigma Link The BC 14.16, BC 16.16 and BC 23.16 models can communicate directly with an Android smartphone via NFC (near field communication). To do so, you must install the free SIGMA LINK app. For wireless data exchange, simply hold your smartphone up to the computer. The app can be used to change settings and read trip data. The data can be transferred from the smartphone into the DATA CENTER via the SIGMA CLOUD. Conversely, it is also possible to transfer data from the DATA CENTER onto the smartphone via the CLOUD. The free SIGMA LINK app is available in the app store and Google Play store. The NFC technology is only available for Android smartphones.   Trip Section Timer Due to the integrated trip section timer, partial sections of an overall trip can be separately entered manually. Thus, the evaluation of a partial section or interval workout is made possible, without affecting the total values of the trip. Temperature Display All models from the BC 14.16/STS/CAD to the BC 23.16 have a temperature indicator. This shows the current temperature of your environment at all times.         Adjustable Wheel Sizes Got more than one bike? Two wheel sizes can be programmed into the BC14.16 to separate ride data. The STS wireless versions automatically switch between bike 1 or bike 2 based on the transmitter signal. Predefined Tire Sizes Setting the wheel size is extremely easy using the tire size. From 16 inches to 700C to 29 inches, the wheel size can be set easily using predefined tire sizes. Of course, it is also possible to manually enter the wheel size in millimetres. Speed Comparison The BC14.16 STS continuously compares current and average speed. When there is a difference, the result is indicated by an upward or downward arrow. Workout Statistics for 12 Months In addition to total values, the BC14.16 STS keeps track of statistics for the last twelve months. The É??workout diaryÉ?ù helps compare and analyze monthly activities. Integrated Storage Chip Thanks to an integrated memory chip in the computer head unit, all the total values and settings are permanently stored in the device. After changing the battery, you therefore only need to reset the time. Computer/transmitter Battery Warning All devices from BC 14.16 upward come with a battery status indicator. The power status of the battery in the computer head unit or STS transmitter is checked at regular intervals. If the battery is low, an early warning is displayed on the computer head unit. Bike Service Reminder Thanks to the service interval, your bike mechanic can set a service reminder based on the number of kilometers/miles that your ride, making sure that your bike is tuned and ready for each ride. The service interval is set using the UNIVERSAL FAST SETTING BOX. When service is due, a bike service icon will appear on your screen at the start of a ride. Simply press any button to dismiss the reminder until a later date.   Digitally Encoded Three-channel Wireless Transmission The tried-and-tested SIGMA TRANSMISSION SYSTEM (STS) is the digitally encoded transmission system for all transmitter data from the speed transmitter, the cadence transmitter, and even the heart rate transmitters for the high-quality basic devices and top models. The transmitters collate the data they have received and send this to the receiver integrated into the computer as a data package. The transmitters also regularly send stored test data for data comparison purposes. The digital encoding of the SIGMA TRANSMISSION SYSTEM prevents transmitter data from being corrupted by external interference such as power sources or other transmitters. The interference of Sigma products, e.g. LED lights, can also be prevented. Bike Functions Ride Time / Training time, Comparison of cur. / avg.

Der DGS-1210-28 hat 24 ""echte"" RJ45 Ports, die 4 Mini GBIC sind also 4 weitere Ports und nicht wie beim Vorg«œnger geshared. Nicht wirklich ein Kaufargument, der um 12É?™ g«¨nstigere Preis des DGS-1210-28 ist es schon eher. Die Entscheidung stand also fest.Lieferung wie immer schnell und problemlos. An der Verpackung von D-Link k«Ùnnte man anmerken, dass andere Hersteller inzwischen vollst«œndig auf Schaumstoffeins«œtze verzichten (speziell, wenn man mit ""Green-IT"" wirbt). Aber nun gut...Geliefert wurde die aktuelle Hardware-Version ""B1"" mit der letzten Firmware. Im Lieferumfang enthalten sind 2 Netzkabel (Schuko und UK), 19"" Winkel, Gummif«¨«?e zum Kleben, Ressource-CD plus Schnellstartanleitung. Die GBIC-Ports sind mit Staubschutzkappen versehen. Der Switch hat keinen separaten Erdungsanschlu«? - hoffen wir mal, dass das Geh«œuse sauber «¨ber das Netzkabel geerdet ist.Nach dem Einbau in das Rack habe ich erst mal nur die wichtigsten Verbindungen f«¨r einen Test gesteckt - die FritzBox 3370 und einen Windows 7 PC.Der Switch hat als Default IP die 10.90.90.90. «?ber das D-Link SmartConsole Tool (auf CD oder per Download) l«œ«?t sich diese «œndern, auch wenn der Client in einem anderen Adressbereich l«œuft.Hier kam das erste Problem: Per DHCP wollte der Switch keine IP-Adresse von der FritzBox holen. Also erst mal eine Adresse manuell vergeben.Zugriff auf die Weboberfl«œche: Sehr schnell (im Vergleich zum Netgear rasend) und gut strukturiert. Sehr zweckm«œ«?ig...an der ein oder anderen Stelle h«œtte etwas mehr Modernit«œt geholfen (Porteinstellungen, Portstatistiken etc. alles in n«¨chterner Tabellenform)Die Oberfl«œche liegt in mehreren Sprachen vor, die beim Login gew«œhlt werden kann. Die deutsche «?bersetzung ist ok, wenn auch nicht vollst«œndig. An wenigen Stellen tauchen spanische oder italienische «?bersetzungen auf. Wer Englisch beherrscht sollte die englische Version verwenden.V«Ùllig an der Realit«œt vorbei haben die Entwickler bei den Einstellungen der Zeitsynchronisierung SNTP gearbeitet. Aktiviert man die Daylightsaving (Zeitumstellung) Funktion, muss man dann doch tats«œchlich ein festes Kalenderdatum (Monat und Tag) des Umstellungstages einstellen. IMHO nutzt kein Land der Erde einen festen Kalendertag f«¨r die Zeitumstellung, sondern doch eher sowas wie ""letzter Sonntag im Oktober"" o.«œ. Letztendlich unbrauchbar und von mir auch ungenutzt. Der Switch holt sich die Zeit von der FritzBox, wenn man diese als NTP-Server eintr«œgt.Wenn, ja wenn, er den mal sauber mit der FritzBox kommunizieren w«¨rde. Tat er leider nicht. Auch der angeschlossene Windows 7 PC hat vom Fritzbox DHCP-Server keine IP-Adresse mehr bekommen. Mit einem DHCP-Testool auf dem Windows 7 PC konnte ich lediglich feststellen, dass der DHCP Discover Broadcast im Netzwerks unbeantwortet verhallte. Nach stundenlanger Suche, rumprobieren und verzweifeln habe ich sogar einen Case beim D-Link Support aufgemacht. Dieser ist angesichts des Wochenendes nat«¨rlich noch nicht beantwortet.Jetzt hatte ich so viele Einstellungen im Switch und FritzBox probiert, dass ein Werksreset des Switches sinnvoll war. Danach habe ich ausser der festen IP erstmal gar nix mehr verstellt - lief trotzdem nicht. Internetverbindung war vorhanden, aber DHCP wollte nicht. Auch die in der Zwischenzeit angeschlossenen TP-Link Access-Points konnten den angemeldeten WLAN Ger«œten keine IP-Adresse vom DHCP holen.Im Internet fand ich dann weitere Leidensgenossen, die Probleme mit diversen Switches an einer FritzBox hatten. Viele berichteten, dass eine Einstellung der Ports in der FritzBox von ""Power-Modus"" (=Gigabit) auf ""Green"" (=Fast Ethernet) Besserung brachte. Bei mir leider nicht.Aber : der D-Link hat auch PowerSaving-Einstellungen, die standardm«œ«?ig aktiviert sind (Cable Length Detection und Link Status Detection)Nach Deaktivierung dieser Funktionen ging pl«Ùtzlich alles. Der DHCP-Server der FritzBox war erreichbar! Muss ich nicht verstehen...Die restlichen Einstellungen waren dann schnell gemacht und funktionierten sofort. Nutzen tue ich noch LACP f«¨r mein Netgear ReadyNAS und VLAN-Tagging f«¨r die WLAN Access-Points. Den Rest der vielen Layer2-Features und Reporting-Features wie RMON, SNMP nutze ich nicht.Fazit:F«¨r knapp 130 É?™ bekommt man einen wirklich gut ausgestatteten und sparsamen 24/28 Port Gigabit-Smart-Switch. Die Oberfl«œche k«Ùnnte man sicher noch optimieren, erf«¨llt aber schnell und einfach ihren Zweck.W«¨rde ich wieder kaufen und auch weiterempfehlen.",[],"[""FREE delivery October 27 - 30.

It installs easily. It's easy to use the folds to have it in landscape view. I was looking for a case will full coverage for extra protection. This had some open spots like most cases. I would recommend it. It looks exactly as online, just not what I was looking for this time.very sturdy and fits perfectlyI looked and compared for a really long time for a case for my new kindle and finally settled on this one. It is durable, sturdy, and I really like the color. There are a lot of options for positioning the table for viewing and typing which is nice. It does not cover the speakers at all, so when you prop it up to watch something the sound is fine. Here is my one issue. When you want to watch something on the tablet and you want the speakers to be at the top so the sound is better, you have to fold the tablet into a position where the inside of the cover is face out on whatever surface you have the tablet on. So, if I want to put my tablet on a surface that is a little dirty or sticky, the inside velvet surface will be sitting on it. If you don't mind watching something with the speakers face down, where the sound will be slightly blocked, you will fold the tablet with the outside side protected surface of the tablet on the surface you have it resting on. Of course, this is not a problem at all if you are using earbuds because you won't be needing to use the speakers, which is what I do most of the time anyways. So while it is an issue for me, it is only a small issue. But I don't think this is the fault of the tablet case, it is due to the speakers being put on the wrong side of the tablet.Looks like leather it looks really nice definitely recommendI was a little hesitant of getting this cover b/c I was afraid the Fire would flop around since the cover only connects to half the back but it surprisingly works really well. And it seems like the cover is magnetized to the back when opened which helps hold it in place. Cover seems solid and rugged, was surprised how heavy it felt out of the bag. Holding it to type this now I can feel the weight so best not to use this with your arm in the air. Feels fine resting my hand on my leg.Got the gilding design, looks and feels good.There is a cutout for the back camera when you open the lid all the way, sort of 3/4 around. Folding it in a triangle, the way you would use it for the front camera on top to Zoom, makes a big handle for taking back camera pics. Not that I'd ever take a pic w/ a Fire tablet.Being able to have the camera on top for Zoom is the reason I bought this cover, having the cover also open ""halfway"" w/ the buttons on top where they belong is also good.Has anybody asked Amazon why they put the front camera on the wrong side? Well until they move it back where it belongs, probably in 2 years for the next model, this is a good cover to get.When I bought my new Fire HD10+, I ordered the keyboard case with it, not realizing it would be heavy and not really convenient for streaming. I had this Timovo style case with my very first Fire, so looked for that again. This is a great case. The magnets are so strong and secure that there is no concern about slipping when in the horizontal position for streaming and the cover holds tight to keep the tablet asleep securely.The graphic that I picked - looks like the Milky Way Galaxy - is very cool. The cover is quality vinyl and the felt liner is soft and appears sturdy. Highly recommend. Now I have this light weight cover for when I don't need the keyboard attachment.I bought this case as well as another brand that had good reviews. This one was so much nicer. It didnÉ??t feel like cheap plastic and was much better quality. It was even stands well on a bed and the sleep function works as described. IÉ??ve had the Amazon brand case previously for the Fire HD 8, and this case is much nicer overall.The main draw back is the fact that this cover will not allow magnetic charging. I knew this before I purchased and was drawn to the design and sturdiness. But, if you are interested in desktop magnetic charging look around for another product.(The Amazon 2021 10) tablet is new so they case price cost around ∂ú20. The case looks smart, professional and feels decent. The camera hole is on the hard part of the case which hold the tablet, the outer material case doesn't have one. It study and isn't easily pushed over depending on the flap set-up. I hope to take the tablet to work and will update about longevity of the case. I've attached pictures hopefully it helpsThere is no hole in the case for the rear camera. How can they advertise this as suitable for the item in question.Bought for my mum for her new HD Fire, had it sent direct to her address. She says it's a nice coloured case, however, was perplexed that it did not have a hole in the back for the camera? Possibly a faulty one? Sadly I can't send it back as in the meantime, my dad has now drilled a hole in the back of it so the camera can be used, of a sorts if you ignore the frayed edged frame to the photos! Can't wait to see it!I thought at first this was quite expensive compared to others I've bought but I am genuinely not disappointed with the case.It is a great fit and good quality case.Arrived in good time too More than happy and would definitely recommendIt fits the tablet well, provides good protection and is just what I needed.",null,"[""FREE delivery Tuesday, October 18 if you spend $25 on items shipped by Amazon"",""Or fastest delivery Monday, October 17.

Because of the magnet connection to adhere the ipad to the cover (which is plenty strong - no issues there), all the function buttons and fingerprint sensor are properly exposed. The flap covering the pencil is ideal and that flap folds back flat and is secured magnetically when you have the front cover folded back. It is pebbly finished leather (but that is indistinguishable from ""real pu leather"" (what an oxymoron).Very minimalistic, adds very little weight and thickness to the iPad.Just got mine a few hours ago, coming from the apple version. I love the leather, looks and feels great. I also appreciate how they put 2 magnets where the latch closes, so it locks in place with or without the Apple Pencil. ItÉ??s all about the details. My only worry is the magnets. I read all the reviews saying they were weak but decided to send it anyways. They are not as bad as some of the reviews made it seem, though compared to the apple one you can definitely notice a difference. Just means you have to be careful with your $600 device, as you should already be doing. DonÉ??t trust the magnets to save your device. WouldnÉ??t trust the apple one like that either. Solid product. Wish they had it with the red stitching like the other model, but the black is clean. Give it a try if youÉ??re willing to be careful with your device. Will update if magnets lose any noticeable strength over time.The magnets work perfectly, been using it for almost a month now, and my iPad had never fallen off or slid out of place. I am not super satisfied with the leather tho, as it feels a bit too rough to the touch, plasticky even. It does look and smells like real leather, I guess, but the quality of said leather doesn't strike me as a super-quality one.Up side is nice quality casecand good power shut off.A bit pricey but it's leather and looks good. Hey, still cheaper than Apple with quality fit and finish.Fine leather construction with an open-sided design for maximum access to flush mounted top buttons. Unlike earlier designs that had a retaining surround with access holes, this case relies on weak magnets embedded in the back to secure the iPad. ItÉ??s fairly easy to dislodge the iPad if youÉ??re careless. Otherwise a thin, light weight leather case that should hold up well.I like that it is very purpose built. It does a great job of protecting the ipad while at the same time staying out of the way and unobtrusive . The trifold design of the cover does a great job at doubling As a stand. I use the ipad mainly as a source of music for headphone listening.The overall quality of the look and feel of this case is wonderful! It is a small footprint, with no extra bulk and it is sleek and easy to hold. The magnetic closure keeps everything secure. Regarding the ""hold"" of the magnet . . . I agree with many of the other reviews in that it just doesn't hold very well. Every time I open the magnetic flap closure and go to open the front cover, the back cover peels off instead. Also, when I am using the iPad and I hold it vertical, it sometimes just falls off the magnetic back. I love the design, so I am living with it, but maybe not much longer. Wish they would fix this.Having tried some cheaper cases, the Torro feels superior in its function and quality. Both the front and rear of the iPad is nicely protected, with the magnetic case holding the pad nicely in position. However, when opening the case you need to be sure you open the case cover and donÉ??t grip the iPad otherwise the case will break free.The magnets are sturdy once the iPad is seated. The overall quality of the case is excellent with a magnetic flap ensuring the case remains closed when not in use.To improve IÉ??d suggest corner protection could be incorporated, this would also ensure you donÉ??t accidentally detach the iPad from the case when opening.To conclude, IÉ??d highly recommend this case, cheaper options just feel inferior while the official Apple case is simply too expensive.This is a very nice, sleek, good quality case for iPad Pro. It would not prevent an accident if the iPad was to fall on a concrete floor, but it certainly provides a good overall protection from scratches, and does the job of a good folio case, i.e. stand.It's made of real, good quality leather, it's super light, and uses magnets to stick to the back of the ipad, leaving every side of the tablet completely free which I love.The case securely folds round my Ipad Mini, the magnets holding it firmly in place. Good quality, and works well, the only concerns I have are that you have to ensure the device is fitted correctly otherwise it can slip out of the bottom of the case. Only purchased the case this week, so will see how it goes.overall well made but be aware your iPad mini can fall out when you open up not every time but doesnt always hold in case securely normally all of the Torro products i have had have been excellent this looks the part butLove it. Originally got a cheap cover which didnÉ??t sit right with how lovely my iPad is so got this worth it and is sturdy and safe.

"R-Go Split Ergonomic Keyboard, QWERTY (US), Black, Wired USB Keyboard (QWERTY (US) / Spilt, Wired/Windows, Linux)",,R-Go Tools,"R-GO TOOLS ERGONOMIC SPLIT KEYBOARD R-GO TOOLS ERGONOMIC SPLIT KEYBOARD Chances are you have a kink in the wrists while typing. That happens automatically when you use a standard keyboard. In order to be able to type with straight wrists, we have developed an ergonomic split keyboard that consists of two separate parts. These parts can be placed freely on the desk so that you can type in a healthy way in any working position. Our keyboards stand out for their minimal thickness. A flat keyboard provides a flat, relaxed position for the hands. This way the tendons in the wrists are relieved and the blood circulation in your hands remains intact. The special scissor mechanism in the keys provides a light keystroke, so you need less power to type. Do you also find it difficult that, if you are right-handed, with a standard keyboard you always have to reach sideways to the mouse? By constantly reaching out with your right arm, you can burden your wrist and shoulder unnoticed. To avoid overloading, it is important to keep both hands within shoulder width. ThatÉ??s why our ergonomic keyboards are designed to be compact. R-GO SPLIT BREAK KEYBOARD CONNECTION FOR R-GO NUMPAD PAUSE: There are USB ports on two sides of the keyboard for the R-Go numpad break. COMPACT, LIGHT MODEL: Never reach sideways for your mouse again. Easy to transport, so ideal for travel. BUILT-IN MAGNET: Transform your split keyboard into a compact keyboard in one swift movement. SMALL DESIGN: A perfect design for relaxed, flat wrists when typing. EASY KEY PRESS: The special scissors mechanism in the keys ensures a light keystroke. RECYCLED PLASTIC: This keyboard is made from recycled plastic. PATENTED PAUSE INDICATOR. Read more ERGONOMIC KEYBOARD WITH PAUSE DISPLAY The patented R-Go Break software uses color signals to indicate when it is time to take a break. As you type, the light changes color like a traffic light: Green: All right! Orange: time for a short break. Red: You worked too long. This way you will receive positive feedback about your break behavior. Read more NEVER REACH FOR MOUSE AGAIN WITH R-GO COMPACT/SPLIT KEYBOARD When using both keyboard and mouse at the same time, your hands always stay within shoulder width. This natural posture reduces muscle tension in your shoulder and arm and prevents RSI complaints.

My Caps Lock key is only working for the left side of the keyboard. The Shift-keys are only working for the same part of the keyboard, not for both sides. Can this be fixed? A. You're probably using a system with macOS installed on it. Unfortunately, macOS doesn't let the computer use two keyboards (parts) with one wire which causes the issue that some keys on the one part, aren't working for the other part. But, this can be fixed. Follow the steps below: Download the application Karabiner-Elements here Install the application and open it. Make sure you are on the tab named 'Simple Modifications' at the top of the window. At the bottom left side, you see a button named 'Add item'. Click on it, and you will see a new line appear in the field above the button. Under 'From key', click on the selector and select 'left_shift'. Now click on the selector under 'To key' and select 'right_shift'. Click 'Add item' at the bottom left side again, a new line will show up in the field above. Under 'From key', click on the newest selector and select 'right_shift'. Now click on the newest selector under 'To key' and select 'left_shift'. Your keyboard should work fine now. If it is still not working, try to reboot your computer or send a message through ""ask seller"" on Amazon. Q. I get the following error: ""The last USB device you connected malfunctioned, Windows does not recognize it"", what should I do? A. Press or click the windows button in the left down corner of your screen, then search for ""Bluetooth and other devices"" and click the result. You will be redirected to the settings screen. Click on the USB Keyboard driver and delete it. Then disconnect and redirect the keyboard to your devices. The drivers will be reinstalled and everything should work now. Q . Is it possible to turn off the light in the upper left corner? A. Yes, this is possible. You can do so by pressing the keycombination ""Fn""+""A"". If the light is already turned off and you want to turn it on again, you can press the same combination to do so. Q. The right side of my keyboard types numbers instead of the letters u,i,o,j,k,l and m. How can I fix this? A. When this happens, the internal numpad of the keyboard has been activated. You can turn this off by pressing the Num Lock key on the keyboad. This key is located on the top row, the third key from the right. Q. Why is this keyboard so flat, that is not ergonomic right? A . Our keyboards are made as flat and thin as possible due to ergonomical reasons. When you use a keyboard with a height adjuster underneath you bend your wrists in order to reach all the keys. By bending your wrists, you block the blood circulation going through your hands. That is why our keyboards are flat and thin so the blood circulation to your wrists does not get blocked.

I was looking for a thin split keyboard to make a portable ergonomic rig for travel.This keyboard fits the bill as it is very slim. In spite of the thinness, the key travel is significant and feels very good. There's no wobble in the keys. If you're familiar with Dell XPS, Macbook Pro (2015 and 2018), and modern Thinkpad laptops, this feels most like a Thinkpad X1 or T460 keyboard. Solid and comfortable.A nice surprise was that the casing is made of brushed metal, not plastic, it feels very durable and doesn't move around on a desk.The one think I would change is the Enter key, which is like a very skinny ISO Enter, and the placement of /? and \|. Its easy to hit those keys when you're trying to hit Enter and Shift. It takes some getting used to. The 6 key is on the right half, which is standard if you've learned to type 6 with the right hand, but may be surprising to some as many splits have the 6 on the left half.The halves connect with a micro-usb to micro-usb cable, and two are included in case you lose or break one or want to connect the Ergoguys numpad (which canbe connected on either side, a nice touch for lefties). A standard OTG cable also works.All in all, this is one of the better split keyboards I've used, with exceptional quality construction and key feel, and a uniquely slim design that makes it very portable. I'm taking one star off for the three key placement issues above; but the rest of the keyboard makes up for it. This is the best portable solution I've found so far; it's compact enough there's no reason to travel without a split keyboard and endure pain from typing on a standard laptop. That alone is well worth the learning curve, and the keyboard pays for itself as it saves me from having to see an occupational therapist or of take time off work because of RSI.Highly recommended.I was very excited to get this keyboard. It is very sharp and cool looking but it doesn't quite meet my expectations of a keyboard that cost this much money. Here's why:1. When you use the SHIFT keys, you have to use the SHIFT key that is on the same side of the keyboard. If you want to hold SHIFT on the left side and then press keys on the right side of the keyboard, it doesn't work. This is very inconvenient. :(2. You have to hit the keys harder than what i am used to so that the keystroke is registered. (not a deal breaker)3. The keyboard uses a rubber-like material around the keys and the rest of the top of the keyboard. This material shows dirt and oils from your fingers very quickly. After my first day of use, my keyboard looked gross. I am basically having to clean it daily. Maybe I should be cleaning my keyboard daily anyway, but I've never seen a keyboard appear this dirty so quickly!4. Sometimes the keyboard jus stops working. To fix this, just unplug and plug it back in and it works. not sure if its my computer or the keyboard itself. (I'm using a MacBook Pro 2015)This was THE keyboard really. Loved it's compactness yet enough place for my fingers to roam, silent as it could be , perfect height for my palm pads, delete is separte key from backup and placed where it should be. Escape button placed exactly where it shpuld be. Very ergonomic.Then why 2 stars?Cause they messed up with the two most used keys placement. For absolutely no reason. The enter key must be above the shift key in HORIZONTAL size. They could just leave the pipe and slash button above the enter key as is the pattern. Everytime i went to hit wnter it just gave me a slash and when you are to write a 10k words essay IT IS FRUSTRATING. Same on the left side. I don't need two pipe and slash buttons!!! It messes up the SHIFT keys placement and typing. This is the biggest issue and I was tempted tomjust guve 1 star. But it is a very good product otherwise.*** If they fix this I'll buy it again in a an instant!This is just very close to the perfect keyboard for me. I love the simplicity of the design and the split. As far as I can tell, it's the best design on the market for a compact, low-profile butterfly-switch split keyboard. The keys are comfy with very quick action and low noise despite a very clear actuation feel.Reliability:I bought two. the first had a sticky 'O' key, and the second only lasted a few months before it started malfunctioning every once in a while - multiple times a day, the right side would stop working. Generally I had to unplug the right from the left and re-plug it and it would start working again, but eventually I couldn't get it to start working again.Key placement issues:I agree with some of the key placement issues raised by others, in particular the outdated vertical Enter key. Horizontal is better and more common in the US. I contacted their product department and they said this is because they share the mold with other international layouts that don't have the horizontal Enter.I also dislike the fact that Num Lock is shared between this and my 10-key... it means whenever I want to use my 10-key for entering numbers, the keyboard becomes useless because much of the right side starts typing numbers instead of letters.The switches are pretty good for scissors and the metal frame makes it feel high quality. The layout is questionable though, especially the left shift key for me.Pro:1. Quality material. Metal frame makes it feel high quality.2. Good scissor switches. They are crips and responsive.3. Thin profile is a pro IMO.Cons:1. Questionable layout. Why is there a key between the left shift and z?2. Price is on the high side.3. Micro usb is minor, but it should be usb-c for the price.4. Not 100% sure because I only use it for a few minutes but I don't think it had legs to tilt it. This could be an issue for some users.A coworker recommended getting a split keyboard after I mentioned having neck pains, but I didn't want a mechanical keyboard. This was the closest I could find to the Apple keyboards I was already using - I bought the US model as it's closer to the Apple UK layout. It does need a bit of extra setup on a Mac, but the instructions for how to install and configure Karabiner-Elements are clear and easy to follow, and it also lets you remap the keys to be more like the Apple layout. It's a little stiffer than the keyboard it replaced, but I think that's to be expected given the old one was nearly ten years old!I do miss having a numeric keypad. The R-GO website lists one as an add-on, but I haven't seen it available anywhere. I hope they release it soon!Oh, and I've only had it a few weeks, but I haven't had a stiff neck since switching to this keyboard. So, fingers crossed, it's working!I bought this keyboard back in January and used it pretty often; the keyboard itself is good for typing, however, the cabling is pretty faulty; every time you move your keyboard it disconnects from the computer between each side. After 8 months the right side stopped working, I tried using different cabling as it has happened before, but this time it seems that the right side got faulty completed. Customer support neither is the best. I DO not recommend buying this productThat is all I can say, the microUSB soldering is probably loose on the inside of the keyboard. Sometimes only the right side works, sometimes the whole keyboard doesn't work. This started happening yesterday.Das R-Go Keyboard hat eine hervorragende Haptik, der Anschlag ist gut, die Tastatur flach und eben - «œhnlich meiner Cherry G85. Die Teilung der Tastatur ist gut gew«œhlt. Ich tippe normalerweise auch Tasten links mit der rechten Hand und umgekehrt; das geht jetzt nicht mehr und trotzdem ich habe die Teilung nicht als st«Ùrend empfunden. Die H«œnde liegen ausgestreckt gerade ueber den Tastenfeldern, je nach pers«Ùnlicher Vorliebe angeordnet. Das funktioniert gut. Die Verarbeitung ist gut, die H«œlften passen genau zusammen. Die Tastatur ist schwer genug, so da«? sie nicht aus Versehen beim Schreiben verrutscht.Allerdings gibt es einige Punkte, mit denen ich nicht so gut zurechtkomme,1. die rechte H«œlfte der Tastatur funktioniert nicht mit meinem Aten CS1764A KVMP Switch. Anscheined ist das ein bekanntes Problem, denn in der Anleitung wird darauf hingewiesen, da«? die Tastatur nicht an einem USB Hub betrieben werden soll, sondern direkt am Computer. F«¨r mich bedeutet es, da«? ich die Tastatur nicht zum Umschalten zwischen mehreren Rechnern nutzten kann.2. Der auf der Tastatur blau markierte Zehnerblock funktioniert nicht.3. Die Home/End/PgUp/PgDn Tasten sind auf der linken Seite oben untergebracht, und erfordern Handgymnastik, denn dort ist auch die Fn Taste. Fuer kompliziertere Man«Ùver, wie das Markieren von Text bis an den Anfang, brauche ich dann Shift, Fn und Home, alles auf der linken Seite.4. Die Tastatur ist kompakt, d.h. der Pfeiltastenblock ist nicht mehr separat. Das ist schade, denn gerade beim Arbeiten mit Excel oder beim Programmieren brauche ich die Pfeiltasten und Home/End/PgUp/PgDn st«œndig. Ich h«œtte mir die Pfeiltasten und Home/End/PgUp/PgDn als abgesetzte Tasten auf der rechten Seite gew«¨nscht.Fuer Menschen, die viel Text schreiben, und Schreibmaschinentechnik beherrschen, einen Versuch wert. Ich habe sie jedoch aus den genannten Gr«¨nden zur«¨ckgegeben.El teclado es malo, es solo un teclado partido por la mitad, asi que realmente ergonomico no es (las teclas siguen en una hilera rigida, no se puede elevar un poco, no trae apoyo para las munyecas). Tiene algunas fallas de disenyo tambien. La tecla del espacio del lado izquierdo esta mal ubicado para diestros, algunas combinaciones de teclas no salen facilmente (es una loteria ver si el shift izquierdo va a funcionar o no). Con eso en mente, es una buena introduccion al teclado partido para dar el salto a un teclado verdaderamente ergonomico.

Let me share my experience with this crystal black case that has left me torn between satisfaction and frustration.First off, the case's appearance is sleek and eye-catching. The crystal black finish adds a touch of elegance to my MacBook Air, and the transparent design showcases the Apple logo beautifully. It's definitely a head-turner and has received many compliments from friends and colleagues.Installing the case was a breeze. The snap-on design ensures a secure fit, providing protection for both the top and bottom of my laptop. The precise cutouts allow for easy access to all ports and buttons, without compromising functionality.However, I encountered a minor setback when it came to heat dissipation. After extended use, I noticed that my MacBook Air tended to get warmer than usual. It seems the case doesn't allow for optimal airflow, which is disappointing considering its compatibility claims.The case offers decent protection against scratches and scuffs. My laptop has survived a few accidental bumps and drops without any damage. However, I was disappointed to discover that the case itself is prone to scratches. Within a few weeks, it started to show visible signs of wear and tear, which detracted from its overall appeal.On the bright side, the iBenzer case is lightweight, adding minimal bulk to my MacBook Air. It's easy to slip into my bag without adding unnecessary weight, which is perfect for someone always on the go.Now, let's talk about the funny mishap I experienced. Picture this: I'm in a crowded coffee shop, trying to impress a potential client with my slick MacBook Air. As I open my laptop, the case decides to pull off a magic trick and pop off the bottom shell. Talk about a show-stopper moment! Luckily, I managed to snap it back into place, but it left me red-faced and laughing.In conclusion, the iBenzer Plastic Hard Shell Case for the MacBook Air 13 Retina Display with Touch ID has its pros and cons. While it offers a stylish design, easy installation, and decent protection, it falls short in terms of heat dissipation and durability. The lightweight nature is a plus, but the case's tendency to unexpectedly detach is an amusing yet inconvenient quirk.In terms of value for money, the iBenzer Plastic Hard Shell Case offers an affordable option compared to some of the higher-end MacBook cases on the market. While it may not have the same level of durability or premium features, it does get the job done for everyday use.One thing I appreciated about the case is its ease of cleaning. The plastic material makes it simple to wipe off any smudges or fingerprints that accumulate over time. This is particularly useful for individuals who like to keep their MacBook Air looking pristine.However, it's worth noting that the crystal black color may show scratches more easily compared to other color options. So, if you're someone who wants to maintain a flawless appearance, you might want to consider a different color or a different material altogether.Another aspect to consider is the availability of customer support. iBenzer has a reputation for responsive customer service, which is always a plus. If you encounter any issues or have questions about the product, you can expect prompt assistance.Considering all these aspects, I rate the iBenzer case 3 out of 5 stars. It's a decent option for those seeking a visually appealing case with moderate protection, but be prepared for some drawbacks along the way.",null,"[""FREE delivery Thursday, June 1 on orders shipped by Amazon over $25"",""Or fastest delivery Sunday, May 28.

But, as awesome as smart phones are, I found myself frequently wishing I had something in between, for things I didn't really need to drag out the laptop for, but for which the smart phone wasn't quite enough for the task at hand, just due to the limitations of it's size.Enter, the tablet.  While, for a time, I didn't get the idea of such devices, thinking it was just a way to play Angry Birds in more spectacular fashion, and found it actually rather laughable when someone held up a half-cookie-sheet sized tablet to snap a photo of something, the purchase of my Nexus 7 converted me to embracing the ""Tech Trifecta"" of laptop, tablet, and smart phone -- I now have a bridge device perfectly suited to those jobs that are in between what is too much for my phone but which does not require the full resources of my laptop.And, along with the solution, enter the problem, which is that, like other portable devices, for knocking out serious work few mobile machines (including tablets) have adequate keyboards or mouse-like functions to expedite and make-friendly text-based tasks.  For my laptop, I solved the problem long ago by getting a full size external keyboard and mouse (and even have an external monitor for when I'm really logging the hours).  For the phone, I did have a slider smart phone with a Qwerty keyboard for as long as such phones were being made, but I finally had to give that up, once the phones with the most powerful and useful features for business (or fun) were eschewing ""out-dated"" keyboard concepts in favor of total touch screen tech -- which became a greater limitation of phone use for work tasks, even more highlighting the need for a tablet.But, the tablet itself, I found, had the same limitation.  A stylus made navigation easier, but, in terms of heavy typing, although larger, the touchscreen keyboard was still....a touchscreen keyboard.  Yes, virtual keyboards are getting better and better, but, still, for any real work, the tappity tap on a screen just doesn't cut it, at least not for me as a touch typist.  So, it seemed that perhaps my grand new bridge device was going to turn out to be a bridge too far....Enter the hero -- the Microsoft Wedge Mobile Keyboard!  This Bluetooth device is a GEM!!!!  While small enough to be very portable, they have sized it just large enough to be wonderfully easy to type on, so much so that I now rely on it for any situation where I need to send a reply or create a document of more than a few lines.  It just, hands down, beats any touch screen keyboard, in my opinion, and frankly lays waste to many physical keyboards three times its size.Set up is a breeze -- pop off the sturdy top cover (which doubles, for me, as a base to put my Nexus 7 on, when in it's stand, to give it a perfect height for viewing), and it automatically powers on, and your device already knows its little keyboard buddy (after you've completed the super short initial one time set up -- unless you need to re-pair it, but I will mention that later), and, wow, you are instantly typing away at your heart's content.I love that the cover doubles as a power off -- no worry about ever accidentally draining the two AAA batteries -- just put the cover back on, and the keyboard powers itself off.  I have yet to even change the batteries after steady use since I bought it, which is going on a few month's now.Further awesomeness is provided by the fact that the battery compartment beneath the keyboard itself doubles as a built in stand for what the keyboard rests on, putting it at a perfect typing angle.For typing, the keys are crisp and sure, very nicely spaced for such a compact device, and the layout is such that it is not the kind of keyboard design that is frustrating to use or prone to encourage typos with hard-to-hit keys.  Typing is sure, quick and fluid.  There is no lag whatsoever from what you type to what appears as fast as you type it.As if that wasn't enough, the cover/lid is designed as an instant device stand -- just bend it to any angle you want and you can prop a device in it, voila!  Pairing is quick and problem free at first set-up -- at the end of battery compartment is the Bluetooth discovery button, just press and hold and wait for your device to see the keyboard, type in the code it gives, and, as I say, you have an instant and very functional keyboard standing by for any amount of use.I love it even more because of course, it connects to any Bluetooth device, which meant that, just two days after getting it, being out in the field with my laptop, but with none of my ""make tasks friendlier"" laptop accessories, I realized my new keyboard was in my briefcase with my tablet, and, TA DA, instead of using the less-than-convenient laptop keyboard, I just paired the Wedge Keyboard to my laptop, and was off and running.Even more hilarious was pairing it to my smartphone, the next day, when I was without my laptop or tablet, and, instead of the tedious job of answering an email with the phone's small touch keyboard, I paired up my Wedge Keyboard to save the day.Drawbacks?  None, for me.  This is one of the best tech accessory products I've purchased.  You might find that it is not super light when packing it around with you but, I think you'll appreciate, as I do, the solid and sturdy design.  A few extra ounces is worth the quality it exudes.How could it get better?  Well, I think a new tech that is coming out, eventually, is the ability for one Bluetooth device to ""remember"" all the devices it ""talks"" which would eliminate the need to un-pair and re-pair the keyboard when switching from one device to another.  So, I can only say that a future improvement (given that I now use it on three devices) would be adding such a feature to it in future designs.  But, given that pairing from device to device takes just a few seconds, that's nitpicking, lol, and only speaks further to how great the keyboard is, given that I now want to use it on multiple devices.If mobility combined with functionality is your goal, the little workhorse takes the cake.Oh -- and yes, I did type this using my trusty new Wedge Keyboard so, given that's this review IS a bit long, you can thank (or not thank, depending on your view of this review, lol) my new typing ally for being so easy to use that you just can go on and on and on and on.....Highly recommend this great device!* UPDATE:  Jan 2014 -- Just wanted to add, nearly eight months have gone by with regular use on a periodic basis, and I still have not needed to change the batteries.
